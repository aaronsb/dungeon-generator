## Quick Start

### Play the Game
```bash
python3 temple_runner.py
```

### Generate Room Images

1. **Generate/Update prompts and filenames**:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_room_prompts.py
   # This updates temple-map-graph.json with image filenames automatically
   ```

2. **Generate images with local Stable Diffusion**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure SD WebUI is running with --api flag
   python3 generate_temple_images.py
   # Select option 2 to generate missing rooms only
   ```

3. **Or manually create with other tools**:
   - Use prompts from `temple-room-prompts.json`
   - Save with exact filenames specified (e.g., `temple_room_crypt.png`)
   - Place in `room_images/` directory

## Technical Components

### Core Game Engine (`temple_runner.py`)
- **TempleRunner**: Main game loop with time management
- **Player**: Tracks pendants, path, artifact status
- **PrizeTracker**: Awards authentic 90s prizes based on performance
- **Image Display**: Uses chafa for terminal image rendering

### Temple Structure (`temple-map-graph.json`)
- 24 rooms with unique descriptions and challenges
- Multiple interconnected paths (3-4 connections per room)
- Special rooms: Heart Chamber (artifact), Temple Guard locations
- Each room has `image_file` property for visual display

### Prize System (`temple-prizes.json`)
- Participation prizes: Nickelodeon T-shirts, Nestle Crunch
- Round prizes: Moon Shoes, Pogs, British Knights sneakers
- Temple Games: Huffy bikes, Sega Game Gear
- Grand Prize: Trip to Space Camp ($2000 value!)
- Bonus achievements: Speed runs, perfect runs

### Image Generation System
- **Prompts**: Optimized for "90s TV game show set" aesthetic
- **Style**: Ancient Mayan/Aztec temple with dramatic torch lighting
- **Negative prompts**: Excludes modern elements, people, text
- **Integration**: Automatic display when entering rooms

- Start with 2 Pendants
- Getting caught with 0 Pendants = Game Over

### Scoring & Prizes
- Rooms explored affects prize tier
- Speed bonus for completion under 60 seconds
- Perfect run bonus for avoiding all guards
- 100% exploration bonus for visiting all 24 rooms

## Development Notes

### Image Display Requirements
- Install chafa for terminal image display: `sudo apt install chafa`
- Images display at 60x30 character size
- Fallback to text-only if chafa unavailable

### Extending the Game
- Add new rooms: Update `temple-map-graph.json`
- Add prizes: Update `temple-prizes.json`
- Modify difficulty: Adjust timer, guards, pendant count
- Custom legends: Create new artifact stories

## AI Image Generation Tips

### Recommended Prompt Structure
```
Positive: "legends of the hidden temple TV show set, nickelodeon 1990s, 
          ancient mayan aztec temple room, stone walls with hieroglyphs, 
          dramatic torch lighting, [ROOM SPECIFIC ELEMENTS]"

Negative: "modern, contemporary, bright lighting, clean, text, people, 
          contestants, cameras, crew, watermark"
```

### Best Models/Settings
- Stable Diffusion 1.5 or SDXL
- Steps: 30-40
- CFG Scale: 7-8
- Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras
- Size: 768x512 (or 512x768 for vertical rooms)

## Troubleshooting

### No Images Displaying
- Check chafa is installed: `which chafa`
- Verify images exist in `room_images/`
- Ensure image filenames match JSON: `temple_room_[room_id].png`

### Game Performance
- Reduce image size to 60x30 in display_room_image()
- Disable images: Set `self.enable_images = False`
- Adjust time.sleep() delays for faster gameplay
